<h1>Introduction</h1>

<div class="label2">Overview</div><br>
LiteSpeed Web ADC (LSLB) is an affordable, high-performance layer 7 HTTP smart load-balancer application. LiteSpeed Web ADC is feature-rich, secure, and efficient, offering more flexibility than similarly-priced load balancing software. This makes it an excellent choice for small enterprises looking to scale their applications beyond one server â€” both to improve service speed as well as reliability in case of hardware failure.
